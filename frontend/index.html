      <pre>Dice is health, strength, and money

Board is 2 rings, with a “fan” between the rings
• The fan blades function as bridges between the inner and outer rings
• The fan blades move every turn

Players start on the inner ring

    a. Monster moves lowest number, fan moves median number, player moves highest number
      i. You control how all 3 of these things move
    b. Move these 3 in any order, you can also split up movement (e.g. if player moves 3, you can first move 2, next move something else, and then move player 1)
  2. If the player lands exactly on a die, they pick it up
    a. Max 3 dice
      i. If you already have 3 dice, you can’t pick up any more
